### A Visual Analytics Dashboard for Pedestrian Infrastructure Evolution & ML Validation

This project is the final deliverable for CS-GY 9223. It is a web-based visual analytics tool built with D3.js and Leaflet that allows users to explore the temporal evolution of pedestrian networks in New York City.

The dashboard serves two complementary goals:

1.  **Temporal Analysis:** Understand how pedestrian networks (sidewalks, crosswalks) have changed over time by comparing ML-generated maps from different years.
2.  **ML Validation:** Assess the accuracy of the `Tile2Net` pipeline by comparing its outputs against ground-truth datasets (e.g., NYC Open Data, OpenStreetMap).

## Features

As outlined in the project proposal, the dashboard will include:

* **Multi-Layer Map View:** A Leaflet/Mapbox map with toggleable layers for different years of Tile2Net outputs, ground-truth data, and aerial imagery.
* **"Visual Diff" Modes:**
    * **Temporal Diff:** Compares two years (e.g., 2016 vs. 2024) to show added, removed, and unchanged paths.
    * **Validation Diff:** Compares Tile2Net output against ground truth for a single year to show correct detections, false positives, and false negatives.
* **Timeline Slider:** An interactive slider to filter the map data by year.
* **Linked Metrics Dashboard:** D3 charts that update with the map, showing high-level temporal metrics (e.g., total sidewalk length over time) and validation metrics (e.g., precision/recall per year).

## Project Setup & Installation

### 1. ML Pipeline (Tile2Net)

This project uses the `Tile2Net` pipeline to generate pedestrian networks from aerial imagery.

```bash
# Clone the Tile2Net repository (as per project slides)
git clone [https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/tile2net.git](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/tile2net.git)
cd tile2net

# Follow their installation instructions (likely using conda)
# conda env create -f environment.yml
# conda activate tile2net
```

### 2. Visualization Dashboard

The dashboard is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript application.

```bash
# No installation needed, just serve the files.
# (e.g., using Python's simple HTTP server)
python3 -m http.server
```

### 3. Dependencies

* Python (for Tile2Net and data processing)
* `geopandas`, `pandas`, `gdal` (for processing GeoJSON/shapefiles)
* D3.js (for visualization)
* Leaflet.js (for the base map)

## Data

The dashboard loads pre-processed GeoJSON files. All processing is done offline.

### Data Sources

* **Aerial Imagery:** [NYC Planimetrics](https://gis.ny.gov/imagery/planimetric-data) (e.g., 2016, 2020, 2024)
* **ML Output:** Generated by running Tile2Net on the aerial imagery for the Lower Manhattan test area.
* **Ground Truth 1:** [NYC Open Data (Sidewalks)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Sidewalk/vfe8-6g4x)
* **Ground Truth 2:** [NYC Open Data (Crosswalks)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Street-Pavement-Markings-Crosswalk/b9th-556j)
* **Ground Truth 3:** [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) (via Geofabrik or Overpass API)
* **Contextual Validation:** [NYC Vision Zero View](https://visionzero.nyc/maps-data/)

### Target Area

* **Location:** Lower Manhattan
* **Bounds:** Canal St (North), Broadway (West), Battery Park (South), East River (East)
